# SciCompiler Digitizer block example
Usage of Wave Digitizer component in SciCompiler


The digitizer block in SciCompiler works as a programmable size FIFO to store waveform. It is possible to define, compiling time, the maximum number of channels, while at runtime it is possible to select which channels effectively dump. 
In respect to the oscilloscope, this modules allows a faster way to dump waveform and have the possibility to partition the total amount of samples in the FIFO on multiple channels.
